This repo is for Simulink, MATLAB and Python codes implementing Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) with all its components.
_Note_: Further details along with the MATLAB and Python codes will be added soon. For now, the Simulink files have been added. The Simulink files are for first-order and second-order, continuous and discrete systems.
